Hooks are abstractions of component logic, data loading, or behavior that can be reused across many components.
They can return anything from pieces of state, to functions, to nothing at all (ie: they perform side effects), to even UI elements.
Test files should also be in a folder with the hook they are testing.
Example:
  useFormElements/
    |  index.ts
    |  useFormElements.ts
